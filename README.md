At the desymfony conference in Madrid, Spain. This company handed out this leaflet
stating the following challenge pointed out here https://github.com/cordoval/dragon/blob/master/src/Dragon/PathEngineCommand.php#L10-L18

I did not submit for the 500 EUR but I wanted to make it public to insist on the
willingness to solve this type of problems and to see how the FOSS community is greater
than the market :)

encouragements in all good!


Psalm 1:

"Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that
sinners take or sit in the company of mockers, but whose delight is in the law of the LORD,
and who meditates on his law day and night. That person is like a tree planted by streams
of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither--whatever they
do prospers. Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away.
Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of
the righteous. For the LORD watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the
wicked leads to destruction."

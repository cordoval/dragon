======

At the desymfony conference in Madrid, Spain. This company handed out this leaflet
stating the following challenge pointed out here https://github.com/cordoval/dragon/blob/master/src/Dragon/PathEngineCommand.php#L10-L18

I did not submit for the 500 EUR but I wanted to make it public to insist on the
willingness to solve this type of problems and to see how the FOSS community is greater
than the market :)

encouragements in all good!
